User's Manual

1. How to execute the code:
This has already been mentioned clearly in the readme.txt file in the zip archive.

2. How data is specified in the program:
I have used templates in the facts-trial.clp file to define most of the facts structures like for the packages, trucks, package-report, truck-report etc.

These templates are then further used to establish all the facts.

3.Output generated can be seen in the simulation table.
