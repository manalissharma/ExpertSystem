ExpertSystem

Dated: April, 2014 

This project is a part of my Graduate Coursework for Expert Systems/ Knowledge Based Systems at the University of Florida. The objective of this system was to pick up packages from a given set of places in Florida and Deliver them to their destinations. The details of these packages and trucks have been specified in separate files.
This project is divided into 2 parts.

Part 1 is where each truck is allowed to pick up only single packets on its way until the delivery of that packet. The simulation results can be seen in a separate file "s-table.txt" in that folder. This simulation was run on a single set of data.

Part 2 is where we were free to pick up many packages on our way or do any other manipulation from which we felt our simulation would benefit. This code was run on more than 1 data sets.
